Teamwork is all around us in life. We see it in marriages, businesses, neighborhoods, churches, etc. God loves to see Christians working together submitting to His will. Think of Christianity as your local Walmart. There is one store, but there are many different departments within that store. One department can do things another cannot, but they still have the same goal.In Christianity there is one body, but there are many different functions. God has blessed us all differently. Some people are preachers, givers, singers, advice givers, prayer warriors, etc. We fill in for our brothers where they need assistance.
